# OpenFFBoard-hardware-Nema34-P
This contains the hardware designs of the OpenFFBoard fork for Nema 34 P-Series

These are work in progress.
No guarantee for functionality or safety! The designs are NOT FINAL.
The firmware is available in the main [OpenFFBoard](https://github.com/Ultrawipf/OpenFFBoard) git.

This project requires soldering of many fine pitched parts.
The motor driver must be made with 2oz copper!

Full Kits will be available later once everything is tested. Check the [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/gHtnEcP) and [project page](https://hackaday.io/project/163904-open-ffboard) for updates.

The USB interface can be ordered partially assembled at [jlcpcb.com](jlcpcb.com). Files are in the assembly folders.


**If you want to sell any hardware of this project yourself i would kindly ask you to get in contact with Ultrawipf ([mail](mailto:ffboard@y-richter.de) or Discord)**
